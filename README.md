Created and implemeneted a templated AVL Tree class
Created a basic search engine program by using AVL Tree
Firstly, the program preprocesses the files that contain words. In the preprocessing process, the words are stored in an AVL Tree with the count of the appearance in each file.
After preprocessing is done, the program takes a set of words from the user in order to find out the count of appearances of the each word in the files.
